        Computers are like cars, they can be fast, small, big, but more
        importantly, they can be slow or broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like a car, a computer needs to be maintained to prolong its
        lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>

        computer... and prevent a computer sized hole in your window.
